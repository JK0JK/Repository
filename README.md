# UpdatedCostume
I have recently found a "costume" feature for Pokemon Emerald decomp hacking, designed by Slawter666, that lets you change the player's OverWorld sprite on the fly. It also replaces dynamic palette fixes, since it is dependant on them to work properly.
The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/Slawter666/pokeemerald/tree/costume

The original repository is outdated as of the 6th of July of 2021 and since I need it for Minigame Investigator, my rom hack, I'll be submitting the changes to the current version of the pokemon emerald decomp.
You can use this as a base for your project, if you need it, instead of manually inserting the code yourself.
